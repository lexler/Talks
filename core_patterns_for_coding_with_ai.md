## Description
### Title: Core Patterns for Coding with AI

The rules of software development have shifted. After more than a year of coding with AI across projects and problems, the essential patterns have started to emerge. This talk focuses on the foundations: how to manage what AI knows, how to make it more reliable, and how to communicate without accidentally sabotaging yourself. You'll leave with practical approaches that work across tools and keep working as everything changes.
