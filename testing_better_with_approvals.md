## Description
### Title: Testing Better with Approvals

Tests provide much more than simple regression. The tests scenarios tell a story of what your code does and how it's used.
Unfortuantely, most unit tests obscure this in setup, mocks, and cyrptic asserts.
We're going to look at a few stories of taking unit tests and making them more expressive, so you can get a better sense of the story
they are trying to tell, while at the same time making them easier to write.
