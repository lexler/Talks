## Description
### Title: Augmented Coding: Mapping the Uncharted Territory

Developers find themselves in a world where old maps no longer apply. The rules of software development have fundamentally shifted, and continue shifting at unprecedented speeds.

Drawing from a year of exploration, this talk reveals where AI truly shines - from rapid prototyping to uncovering what we didn't know we didn't know - and hidden dangers that can erode the very trust our software depends on.

Come discover the patterns emerging from this new reality: when to explore freely, when to be careful, and what opens up when the old constraints disappear.
