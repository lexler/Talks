# Lada's Bio

Lada is a seasoned practitioner of extreme programming, Test-Driven Development, and Domain-Driven Design who transforms complex legacy systems into maintainable architectures through incremental improvement and continuous refactoring.

Her approach pairs deep technical expertise with genuine empathy for both end users and fellow developers, creating resilient systems that truly serve their users. 

Over the past year, she's been exploring how to bring the same rigor and craft to AI-assisted development, figuring out what it takes to build reliable software when the tools themselves are unreliable.
