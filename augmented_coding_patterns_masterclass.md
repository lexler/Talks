## Description
### Title: Emerging Patterns for Coding with Generative AI (masterclass)

If coding with AI sometimes feels brilliant and sometimes frustrating, you're not alone. This workshop walks you through a map of the patterns that make it more powerful and predictable, from first experiments to advanced techniques.

We'll explore the inherent limitations of Generative AI alongside the new possibilities it creates - examining not just what
happens, but why it happens. Understanding these underlying dynamics equips you to adapt and combine patterns in powerful ways and come up with your own solutions. Real-world examples will show some of these combinations in action.

You'll leave with techniques that aren't tied to any single LLM or coding agent - practical approaches you can apply immediately, as well as the mental models that keep you effective in this rapidly changing landscape.
