# Telling Better Stories with Tests

## Description
This is a re-telling of an experience in which we started from just getting the code under test, and over many months gradually improved those tests to the point where they became so clear and expressive that they were usable as stakeholder documentation.

Tests provide much more than simple regression. Test scenarios tell a story of what your code does and how it's used. Unfortunately, most unit tests obscure this in setup, mocks, and cryptic asserts.

Great programmers listen to their code. There are so many ways to make tests tell better stories. Each time we pay attention to something that annoys us, we have an opportunity to not only improve the tests and the code â€” each time we see further, so that new issues and insights are allowed to surface with each iteration, cumulatively building on previous improvements.
